		<h5>2021 Strategies for “Socially Distant” University-Company Collaborations</h5>
		<p align="justify">In the early months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly transformed the way the world works and collaborates.  With all work-related travel abruptly curtailed and most professionals working from home, the daily work environment shifted to an ecosystem enabled by online communication and collaboration tools.  In 2021, workflows continue to evolve for both universities and corporations - to better support R&D, education, and ideation.  This panel will discuss how COVID-19-inspired innovation ecosystems have changed – for better or worse –  university-company collaborations. Panelists will share personal observations, challenges, results, and ideas for the future.</p>

          <h4>Workshop Aim</h4>
          <p align="justify">The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss the current state of Software Engineering (SE) research and Industrial Practice (IP), and advance collaboration to reduce the gap between research and practice. <!--Research and business are coupled for the software companies which are transforming intellectual property into products, services and business concepts. However, dissatisfaction regarding the state of interaction between research and practice is not hard to find. Therefore, the challenges are to identify the gaps and to discover ways of improving collaboration, for the mutual benefit of research and industrial practice. --> <br>
		  Researchers can be unaware of real problems and constraints in practice, whereas practitioners may find themselves unable to adopt existing useful research. Practitioners are often reluctant or even prevented from sharing industry information due to confidentiality and legal constraints. Practitioners often feel that researchers work on dated or futuristic theoretical challenges which are divorced from today’s industrial practice. Researchers believe that practitioners are looking for quick fixes instead of using systematic methods. Practitioners have a view that case studies in research do not adequately represent the complexities of real projects and often dismiss results outright when students are used as test subjects in research. Researchers expect good work to take a few years to generate good publications which may affect a specific domain in an incremental manner. Practitioners expect a quick solution which must pay off in the short term. Researchers are more interested in proposing new techniques and tools. Practitioners would appreciate systematic evaluation and comparison of existing techniques and tools in real-world settings. Researchers and practitioners need to overlap research and practice to build trust in their partnership. This workshop is a platform to discuss and address such challenges. </p>

     <h3>Special Theme</h3>
		<p align="justify">The SER&IP 2020 theme is <b>The implications of resurgence in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for research collaborations in Software Engineering (SE)</b>.<br>
			Nowadays there is a surging demand for AI expertise. Industry produces massive datasets for training AI models, which are not easily available in academia. Academia creates advances in AI supporting innovative SE solutions, primarily through theoretical and experimental work, typically not carried out in industry. Therefore, we believe that academia and industry must build a symbiotic relationship, sharing resources and talents, to realize successful collaborative research in AI for SE, and SE for AI. SER&IP 2020 aims to be a platform for effective sharing of knowledge and experience on building such evolved industry-academia relationships. </p>

          <br /><h5 align="center">Emulating zebras and oxpeckers: developing a practitioner-academic mutualistic relationship</h5><br /><p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b><br />In nature we find examples of mutualistic relationships that have evolved together, where each symbiont makes use of each other in mutually beneficial way. One such relationship is that of the zebra and oxpecker – the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks and parasites that live on the zebra’s skin, thus providing the zebra with pest control.  Even where organisms are different, there can be mutual benefits! Are academics and practitioners really so different that we cannot build mutualistic relationships? Or are we even the same species, where one group morphs into the other, in a bi-directional way. Students become practitioners, practitioners become students, academics move to industry, and practitioners come back to universities for further study. We have academics who are also practitioners, and practitioners who conduct research within their own organisations. In this talk, I will question the practitioner-academic divide that is so often spoken about, making the argument that it can be sorted by taking small steps rather than giant leaps. Within Lero, I have been working closely with industry for almost 20 years - a requirement of the funding agency, Science Foundation Ireland. In the early years, having an industry-based project was sufficient. Now, industry have to contribute 50% of individual project funding. As we move into our fourth round of Research Centre funding in 2021, we have has achieved mutualistic relationships with many companies. We know that industry is committed to our research! Illustrating from cases of industry-based research, I will discuss various ways by which academics and practitioners can work together to provide mutual benefits. While discussing the value of publications, I also consider practical on-site research undertaken with industry which our Lero research has shown to be successful. I will discuss initiatives such as workshops, action research, case studies, commercialization, and industry fellowships, showing how these have been successful both for industry at a software engineering and commercial level, and for academics, through significant research outputs. We have become zebras and oxpeckers, supporting each other through mutual research!<br /><br /><b>Biography:</b><br /> Prof Ita Richardson is an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems at the University of Limerick, Co-Principal Investigator within Lero – the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre and a member of the Health Research Institute, University of Limerick.

          <br /><h5 align="center">Work-from-home during and after COVID 19</h5><br /><p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b><br />When Microsoft sent everyone to work from home in March 2020, researchers across the company mobilized to study this huge, uncontrolled ‘experiment’. I will discuss the cross-company initiative to coordinate and learn from the wide variety of research projects studying how remote work has affected individuals, teams, and companies. The initiative consists of over 50 research projects, conducted by teams that span a range of disciplines (including engineering, research, marketing, human resources, and facilities) and divisions (including Microsoft Research, Office, Windows, Azure, Xbox, GitHub, and LinkedIn). 
I will cover some of the over-arching findings around the challenges (and benefits) of work-from-home for collaboration, productivity, and mental well-being. I will then focus on a few studies that I worked on directly – particularly one using Outlook and Teams telemetry data for Microsoft employees, where we try to separate the causal effect of working-from-home from the simultaneous effects of the pandemic. For example, though meeting hours increased, they increased more for those who were already working from home pre-pandemic, suggesting that (in line with previous studies) an individual working from home can be conducive to more focused work, but lead to less collaboration.<br /><br /><b>Biography:</b><br /> Sonia Jaffe is a Senior Research Economist in the Microsoft Office of the Chief Economist.  She is one of the organizers of Microsoft's internal Future of Remote Work initiative. Her other research includes projects in health economics, matching theory, platform markets, and industrial organization. Prior to joining Microsoft in 2018, Sonia was a postdoc at the University of Chicago. She received her PhD from Harvard University in 2015.</p>
